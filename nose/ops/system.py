class ProductionSystem(object):
    """
    A class that provides high-level control over an FCI-7011 fiber coupler
    production system (the :term:`device`). Each instance of this class
    wraps a :class:`~ops.interface.DeviceInterface` object (which handles the
    communication with the device) and complements the low-level functionality
    it provides with a number of high-level services:

    * Instances hold *calibration data* for the device. If this
      calibration data is complete, clients can interact with the device in
      terms of heating temperatures rather than temperature sensor voltages
      and heating currents by using its :attr:`temperature` property and
      :meth:`startHeatingToTemperature` method. The calibration data itself
      is stored in a :class:`~ops.calibration.data.CalibrationData` object,
      and can be accessed using the :attr:`calibrationData` property.

      The necessary data can be gathered by performing a :term:`calibration
      procedure`, which requires the application's user to take a series of
      temperature measurements, and may take several hours. A calibration
      procedure can be started by calling :meth:`startCalibration`.
      See the documentation for :mod:`ops.calibration.manager` for further
      information

      To check whether an instance has a complete set of calibration data for
      its device, use :attr:`isCalibrated`.

    * Instances monitor the device's temperature and temperature sensor
      voltage. If either exceeds its safe limits (:attr:`maxSafeTemperature`
      and :attr:`maxSafeTemperatureSensorVoltage`, respectively), the instance
      is switched into its :term:`safe mode`. In safe mode, the device's
      heating current is set to :attr:`heatingCurrentInSafeMode`, and the
      instance's :attr:`isInSafeMode` flag is set. The instance leaves safe
      mode when a new new heating procedure is started.

    * Instances can be locked. While an instance is locked, clients cannot
      perform any operations on the device without providing the appropriate
      key. This ensures that different operations do not interfere with each
      other.

      To lock or unlock an instance, use the :meth:`lock` and :meth:`unlock`
      methods. To check whether an instance is locked, use the :attr:`isLocked`
      property.

    An :class:`ops.simulation.SimulatedDeviceInterface` object can be
    substituted for the :class:`~ops.interface.DeviceInterface` in order to
    test the application without using an actual device.
